| **Web Framework** | Flask | User interface |
| **Security** | Custom Cryptography | Data protection |

### ⚠️ Development Status & Simulated Components

While Hyper-ZiLLA aims for 100% proprietary AI, some advanced features currently utilize **simulated functional code** for demonstration and architectural integrity. These components are designed to showcase intended functionality and system integration points, but do not yet contain full, production-ready implementations for highly complex domains such as:

-   **Advanced AI/ML Models**: Specific AI logic for OSINT orchestration, facial intelligence, and specialized pattern recognition often relies on simulated responses or simplified heuristics.
-   **Quantum Encrypted Storage**: Represents a conceptual implementation; actual quantum encryption is beyond the current scope.
-   **Advanced Sensor Fusion**: Real-time integration and processing of physical sensor data are simulated.
-   **CAPTCHA & Anti-Tracking Evasion**: While core logic is present, some complex evasion mechanisms are represented by simulated behaviors and dummy data returns.

These simulated sections serve as placeholders for future development and integration of genuine, proprietary, and highly specialized code. Community contributions or further development efforts will focus on replacing these simulated functionalities with robust, production-grade solutions.

### ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# Install (only mathematical libraries, no AI services)
