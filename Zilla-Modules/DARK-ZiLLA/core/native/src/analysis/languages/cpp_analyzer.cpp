// All logic is now within the header, as it was designed to be.
// This file can remain minimal, only providing definitions for any out-of-line
// methods if they were declared as such in the header.
// Given the current design, where methods are defined directly in the class
// declaration within the header, this .cpp file primarily serves as a
// compilation unit for the header and can be expanded if methods are moved
// out-of-line later for larger projects.
