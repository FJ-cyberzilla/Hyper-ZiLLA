# PentestZilla Unified Security Suite

![PentestZilla Banner](docs/banner.png) 
*(Note: 'docs/banner.png' is a placeholder. You may need to create this image or remove this line.)*

PentestZilla is a unified, modular security testing suite designed for authorized penetration testing and security research. It combines various tools, from stable port scanning to experimental AI-driven reconnaissance and network analysis, into a single, easy-to-use command-line interface.

**LEGAL WARNING:** This tool is for authorized security testing only. Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical. Use only on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.

## Features

-   **Modular Design:** Easily integrate new security tools and functionalities.
-   **Stable Port Scanner:** Fast and reliable port scanning with custom ranges and basic stealth options.
-   **Experimental PentestZilla V4:** Explores advanced concepts like Blockchain-verified results, polymorphic scanning, and AI-driven target selection (conceptual implementations).
-   **ZillaBreath (Go Network/Mobile Recon):** A powerful Go-based tool for network and mobile device reconnaissance, including Nmap integration.
-   **Unified CLI:** A central `pz.sh` script for managing and launching all integrated tools.
-   **Cross-Platform (mostly):** Tools are designed with portability in mind, primarily C++ and Go.

## Modules

The suite is composed of the following modules:

1.  **PentestZilla (Stable Scanner)**
    *   **Location:** `src/cpp/pentestzilla/emergency_fix.cpp`
    *   **Description:** A refined, stable TCP port scanner with improved input handling, custom port range capabilities, and a basic stealth mode (longer timeouts, slower pace).
    *   **Dependencies:** Standard C++ libraries.
2.  **PentestZilla V4 (AI/Blockchain/Experimental)**
    *   **Location:** `src/cpp/pentestzilla/pentestzilla_v4.cpp`
    *   **Description:** An ambitious, experimental module showcasing advanced concepts like blockchain-verified scan results, a zero-day vulnerability integration system, quantum-resistant encryption, polymorphic scanning techniques, and autonomous AI target selection. *Note: Some implementations are conceptual or simplified for demonstration purposes.*
    *   **Dependencies:** `libssl-dev` (for `libcrypto`), `libcurl4-openssl-dev` (for `libcurl`), `libpthread`.
3.  **ZillaBreath (Go Network/Mobile Recon)**
    *   **Location:** `src/go/topgear/`
    *   **Description:** A mobile security laboratory (named `topgear` internally) written in Go, focusing on network reconnaissance, device discovery, and vulnerability assessment. Integrates with `nmap` for comprehensive host and service detection.
    *   **Dependencies:** Go programming language (v1.21+), `nmap` (must be installed on your system).
4.  ~~**ZillaTooth (Bluetooth HID Security)**~~
    *   **Location:** `src/cpp/zillatooth/`
    *   **Description:** *(Removed from active build due to complex Bluetooth library dependencies. The source code remains for reference.)*

## Prerequisites

Before installing, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

-   **Git:** For cloning the repository.
-   **g++:** C++ compiler (supporting C++17 and C++20).
-   **make:** Build automation tool.
-   **Go:** Go programming language (version 1.21 or higher).
-   **Nmap:** For full functionality of ZillaBreath.
-   **OpenSSL Development Libraries:** (`libssl-dev` or equivalent) for `pentestzilla_v4`.
-   **cURL Development Libraries:** (`libcurl4-openssl-dev` or equivalent) for `pentestzilla_v4`.
-   **Pthread Development Libraries:** (`libpthread-dev` or equivalent) for C++ modules.

**For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git build-essential golang nmap libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
```
**For Fedora/RHEL-based systems:**
```bash
sudo dnf install git gcc-c++ make golang nmap openssl-devel libcurl-devel
```
*(Adjust commands for your specific Linux distribution or Termux environment if necessary.)*

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/pentestzilla.git # Replace with actual repo URL
    cd pentestzilla
    ```
2.  **Build all modules:**
    ```bash
    ./pz.sh build
    ```
    This will compile all C++ and Go modules and place the executables in the `bin/` directory.

## Usage

PentestZilla can be used either through an interactive menu or via direct command-line execution.

### Interactive Menu

Run the main launcher script:

```bash
./pz.sh
```

Follow the on-screen menu to select and run different tools.

### Direct Execution

You can bypass the interactive menu and run a specific tool directly by providing its name as the first argument to `pz.sh`, followed by any arguments for that tool.

**Syntax:**
```bash
./pz.sh <tool_name> [tool_arguments...]
```

**Available `tool_name` values:**
-   `pentestzilla`: The stable C++ port scanner.
-   `pentestzillav4`: The experimental C++ AI/Blockchain module.
-   `zillabreath`: The Go-based network/mobile reconnaissance tool.
-   `build`: Rebuilds all modules.

**Examples:**

-   **Run PentestZilla (Stable Scanner) with a target:**
    ```bash
    ./pz.sh pentestzilla
    # (Then follow the prompts for target and scan type)
    ```
    Or, for a more direct interaction (depending on the tool's internal CLI):
    ```bash
    # As 'pentestzilla' has an interactive prompt, direct arguments are limited to internal logic.
    # You would typically run './pz.sh pentestzilla' and then provide input.
    ```

-   **Run PentestZilla V4 (Experimental) with default operation:**
    ```bash
    ./pz.sh pentestzillav4
    ```

-   **Run ZillaBreath (Go Recon) with a specific target:**
    *(Note: ZillaBreath uses its own CLI arguments after being launched)*
    ```bash
    ./pz.sh zillabreath --target 192.168.1.0/24 --output json
    ```
    Or, for interactive help:
    ```bash
    ./pz.sh zillabreath --help
    ```

## Building Modules

To clean and rebuild all modules, use the `build` command:

```bash
./pz.sh build
```

You can also build individual modules using `make`:

```bash
make pentestzilla         # Builds the stable C++ scanner
make pentestzilla_v4      # Builds the experimental C++ module
make zillabreath          # Builds the Go network recon tool
make clean                # Cleans all built binaries
```
